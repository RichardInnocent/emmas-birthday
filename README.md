# Emma's birthday bash

Emma's birthday is coming up on the 31st January and we're going BIG ðŸ’ª

## Ideas

I'm thinking of splitting the day down into several sectionsâ€“we'll have a day and evening activity and people can opt into whichever they'd like.

### Day activities

#### Alton Towers Water Park
Emma _loves_ water parks and frequently moans about wanting to go. Having looked at a [few of the best](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attractions-g186217-Activities-c52-t118-England.html) in the UK, [Alton Towers Water Park](https://www.altontowers.com/explore/waterpark/) seems like a winner. It's:

- vaguely centrally located
- highly rated
- indoors so it won't be too cold, even in the depths winter
- flexibleâ€“we have the option to tack on Alton Towers in general if we'd like to

This does put us quite a way away from a city for the evening activities though. We could maybe go to Nottingham from here which is ~1 hour's drive. I'd be happy to ferry people across but there are a few logistical headaches, namely:
- how would people who can't drive get there?
- how would we ferry people across to somewhere for the evening activities?

I could perhaps ferry non-drivers to Alton Towers from a nearby train station that morning but obviously won't be able to do this throughout the day.

#### Monopoly Lifesized
[Monopoly Lifesized](https://www.monopolylifesized.com/) is a game where you play a variation of Monopoly and plays a bit like an escape room. While I don't think she'd enjoy this as much as the water park, it's in London so it'd open up many more options for the evening. This also means it's likely to get more expensive though.
